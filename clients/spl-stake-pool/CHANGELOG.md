## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- d2bcecb: Migrate the toolchain from Biome + ESLint to the [oxc](https://oxc.rs) tooling (`oxlint` + `oxfmt`) with type-aware linting enabled. Source files were reformatted and some renderer modules renamed to kebab-case. No public API changes.
- 855858f: Migrate the package build from `tsc` to [tsdown](https://tsdown.dev). Builds now resolve the shared root `tsdown.config.ts` automatically and emit ESM with type declarations, sourcemaps, and declaration maps (unbundled, preserving source structure). No public API changes.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4592662: Update tooling and dependencies to latest.
  - **@solana/kit v6** (from v5): this is a breaking peer dependency bump for all generated clients. Consumers must upgrade to `@solana/kit@^6`.
  - **Codama renderers**: `@codama/renderers-js` v2 and `@codama/renderers-rust` v3. Generated clients now import shared helpers from `@solana/program-client-core` (declared as a peer dependency alongside `@solana/kit`) and expose a `<program>Program()` client plugin. The previous `shared/` output directory is no longer generated.
  - **Solana program clients**: `@solana-program/{system,token,token-2022,memo}` and `@solana/sysvars` bumped to their latest majors.
  - **Toolchain**: TypeScript 6, ESLint 10, Biome 2.4, Turbo 2.9, and other dev dependencies updated to latest. A 7-day `minimumReleaseAge` supply-chain gate is now configured in `bunfig.toml`.

  All clients have been regenerated against the updated toolchain.

### Patch Changes

- b0b616b: Switch releases to npm OIDC trusted publishing.

  Packages are now published without an `NPM_TOKEN`: the release workflow uses `id-token: write`, and `ci-publish.sh` packs each package with `bun pm pack` (resolving `catalog:`/`workspace:` protocols) and publishes the tarball with `npm publish`, which supports OIDC and generates provenance attestations. No change to published package contents.
