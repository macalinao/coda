description: TypeScript client generation for Solana programs
---

## Welcome to Coda

Coda automatically generates TypeScript clients for Solana programs using Anchor IDLs.

Unlike the built in [Anchor TypeScript client](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/clients/typescript), clients generated by Coda are fully compatible with Anza's [@solana/kit](https://github.com/anza-xyz/kit), the successor to Solana's Web3.js.

Furthermore, since Coda is built on [Codama](https://github.com/codama-idl/codama), you also can get PDA (program-derived address) functions for your program. Code generated clients also contain inline JSDoc code, making it easier for engineers and LLMs to understand how to integrate with your smart contract.

**The workflow is simple:** Supply your Anchor IDL(s), run `coda generate`, and start using your typed client. No configuration required.

## How It Works

Coda reads your Anchor IDL and generates a complete TypeScript client:

```bash
coda generate  # Reads IDL, generates client
```

The generated code is built on [Codama](https://github.com/codama-idl/codama), the same framework used by Metaplex and other major Solana protocols, ensuring reliability and compatibility.
