---

Learn from real-world implementations of Coda in production projects. These examples demonstrate different configuration approaches and use cases for generating TypeScript clients from Anchor IDLs.

## Official Examples

### Token Metadata Client

[View on GitHub →](https://github.com/macalinao/coda/tree/master/clients/token-metadata)

The Token Metadata client showcases Coda's capabilities for a **single program** setup:

- **Single IDL configuration** - Simple `coda.config.mjs` for one program
- **Custom PDAs** - Adds program-derived addresses using Codama visitors
- **Production-ready** - Pre-generated client for Metaplex Token Metadata
- **Type-safe operations** - Full TypeScript support with proper typing

Perfect for projects that need to interact with a single Solana program or want to see how to configure custom PDAs and transformations.

### Quarry Client

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@macalinao/clients-quarry.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@macalinao/clients-quarry)

The Quarry client demonstrates Coda's **multi-program** capabilities:

- **Multiple IDL handling** - Uses glob patterns to process multiple IDLs
- **Workspace management** - Generates clients for an entire protocol suite
- **Shared types** - Manages dependencies between related programs
- **Modular structure** - Organized output for complex protocol interactions

Ideal for protocol developers managing multiple interconnected programs or anyone building comprehensive DeFi integrations.
