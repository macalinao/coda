Learn from real-world implementations of Coda in production projects. These examples demonstrate different configuration approaches and use cases for generating TypeScript clients from Anchor IDLs.

## Official Examples

### Token Metadata Client

The Token Metadata client showcases Coda's capabilities for a **single program** setup:

- **Single IDL configuration** - Simple `coda.config.mjs` for one program
- **Custom PDAs** - Adds program-derived addresses using Codama visitors
- **Production-ready** - Pre-generated client for Metaplex Token Metadata
- **Type-safe operations** - Full TypeScript support with proper typing

Perfect for projects that need to interact with a single Solana program or want to see how to configure custom PDAs and transformations.

### Quarry Client

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@macalinao/clients-quarry.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@macalinao/clients-quarry)
[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@macalinao/clients-quarry.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@macalinao/clients-quarry)

[View on GitHub →](https://github.com/macalinao/coda/tree/master/clients/quarry)

The Quarry client demonstrates Coda's **multi-program** capabilities:

- **Multiple IDL handling** - Uses glob patterns to process multiple IDLs
- **Workspace management** - Generates clients for an entire protocol suite
- **Shared types** - Manages dependencies between related programs
- **Modular structure** - Organized output for complex protocol interactions

Ideal for protocol developers managing multiple interconnected programs or anyone building comprehensive DeFi integrations.

### Kamino Lending Client

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@macalinao/clients-kamino-lending.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@macalinao/clients-kamino-lending)
[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@macalinao/clients-kamino-lending.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@macalinao/clients-kamino-lending)

[View on GitHub →](https://github.com/macalinao/coda/tree/master/clients/kamino-lending)

The Kamino Lending client demonstrates Coda's ability to handle **complex IDLs with overlapping account names**:

- **Overlapping account names** - Handles instructions with duplicate account names across nested structures
- **Automatic flattening** - Intelligently flattens nested account groups to avoid naming conflicts
- **Complex DeFi protocol** - Full lending protocol with deposit, withdraw, and liquidation operations
- **Production-scale IDL** - Processes large IDL with numerous instructions and account types

This example is particularly useful for developers working with:

- Complex DeFi protocols with nested account structures
- IDLs that have evolved over time with naming inconsistencies
- Programs requiring sophisticated account management patterns
- Large-scale production protocols with intricate instruction sets

The Kamino Lending client showcases how Coda's automatic account flattening feature (via `codama-instruction-accounts-dedupe-visitor`) resolves naming conflicts that would otherwise cause compilation errors in generated TypeScript code.
