description: Generate your first TypeScript client with Coda
---

This guide walks you through generating your first TypeScript client from an Anchor IDL.

## Step 1: Build Your Program

First, ensure you have an Anchor IDL by building your program:

```bash
anchor build
```

This creates your IDL file at `./target/idl/your_program.json`.

## Step 2: Generate the Client

Run Coda to generate your TypeScript client:

```bash
bunx @macalinao/coda generate
```

Coda will:
- Locate your IDL (defaults to `./target/idl/`)
- Generate a complete TypeScript client
- Output files to `./src/generated/`

No configuration required for standard Anchor projects.

## Step 3: Use the Generated Client

Import and use the generated functions in your application:

```typescript
import { 
  createTransferInstruction,
  fetchTokenAccount,
  findVaultPda 
} from "./src/generated";

// Create instructions with full type safety
const instruction = createTransferInstruction({
  source: sourceAccount,
  destination: destAccount,
  authority: signer,
  amount: 1000n
});

// Fetch and decode accounts
const account = await fetchTokenAccount(rpc, address);
console.log(account.balance); // Fully typed

// Find program-derived addresses
const [vault] = await findVaultPda({
  user: userPubkey,
  seed: "vault"
});
```

## Generated Client Components

Coda generates a comprehensive TypeScript client including:

### **Instructions**
Typed builders for every program instruction with full IntelliSense support.

### **Accounts**
Fetchers and decoders for all account types with automatic deserialization.

### **Types**
All custom types from your IDL including enums, structs, and unions.

### **PDAs**
Helper functions for program-derived address calculation.

### **Errors**
Typed error definitions for proper error handling.

## File Structure

The generated client is organized as follows:

```
src/generated/
├── index.ts              # Main export file
├── instructions/         # Instruction builders
├── accounts/            # Account types and fetchers
├── types/              # Custom type definitions
├── pdas/              # PDA helper functions
├── programs/          # Program metadata
└── errors/            # Error definitions
```

## Next Steps

- **Start building**: Use the generated client in your application
- **Customize generation**: See [configuration](/docs/configuration) for advanced options
- **View examples**: Check out [example projects](/docs/examples) for reference

## Troubleshooting

**IDL not found**: Ensure your Anchor program is built with `anchor build`

**Import errors**: Use `.js` extensions in imports (required for ES modules)

**Type errors**: Run `tsc --noEmit` to check TypeScript compilation
