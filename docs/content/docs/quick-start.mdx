# Quick Start

This guide will walk you through generating your first TypeScript client from an Anchor IDL.

## Step 1: Ensure Your IDL Exists

Coda looks for your IDL file at `./target/idl/[program_name].json` by default. Make sure your Anchor program is built:

```bash
anchor build
```

This should create a file like `./target/idl/my_program.json`.

## Step 2: Generate the Client

Run Coda to generate your TypeScript client:

```bash
bunx @macalinao/coda generate
```

By default, this will:
- Read your IDL from `./target/idl/`
- Generate TypeScript code in `./src/generated/`
- Include all instructions, accounts, types, and PDAs

## Step 3: Use the Generated Client

Import and use the generated functions:

```typescript
import { 
  createMyInstructionInstruction,
  fetchMyAccount,
  findMyPda 
} from "./src/generated/index.js";
import { createSolanaRpc, pipe, createTransaction } from "@solana/web3.js";

// Create an RPC client
const rpc = createSolanaRpc("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");

// Fetch an account
const myAccount = await fetchMyAccount(rpc, address);

// Create an instruction
const instruction = createMyInstructionInstruction({
  account: accountAddress,
  authority: authorityAddress,
  amount: 1000n
});

// Find a PDA
const [pdaAddress] = await findMyPda({
  seeds: [Buffer.from("my-seed")],
  programAddress
});
```

## What Gets Generated?

Coda generates a complete TypeScript client with:

### Instructions
- Typed instruction builders for every program instruction
- Automatic account resolution and validation
- Full TypeScript IntelliSense support

### Accounts
- Account fetchers with automatic deserialization
- Type-safe account data structures
- Error handling for missing accounts

### Types
- All custom types from your IDL
- Enums, structs, and unions
- Full type safety throughout

### PDAs (Program Derived Addresses)
- Helper functions for common PDA patterns
- Seed-based address derivation
- Integration with account fetchers

### Programs
- Program address constants
- Error type definitions
- Instruction discriminators

## Directory Structure

After generation, you'll see:

```
src/generated/
├── index.ts              # Main export file
├── instructions/         # Instruction builders
│   ├── myInstruction.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── accounts/            # Account fetchers and types
│   ├── myAccount.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── types/              # Custom type definitions
│   ├── myType.ts
│   └── index.ts

├── programs/          # Program metadata

└── errors/            # Error definitions
    └── myProgram.ts
```

## Troubleshooting

**IDL not found**: Ensure your Anchor program is built with `anchor build`

**Import errors**: Make sure you're using `.js` extensions in your imports

**Type errors**: Run `tsc --noEmit` to check for TypeScript compilation issues
