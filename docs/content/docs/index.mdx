# Welcome to Coda

Coda is an automated client generation tool for Solana programs. Built on top of [Codama](https://github.com/codama-idl/codama), Coda provides a zero-config CLI that transforms Anchor IDLs into modern TypeScript clients with full type safety and ES modules support.

## Features

- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with Anchor projects
- **Full Type Safety**: Generated clients include comprehensive TypeScript types
- **ES Modules**: Modern import/export syntax with `.js` extensions
- **Custom PDAs**: Support for program-derived addresses with custom seeds
- **Extensible**: Built on Codama for advanced customization

## Quick Start

Install and generate your first client:

```bash
bunx @macalinao/coda generate
```

This will look for `./target/idl/program.json` and generate a TypeScript client in `./src/generated/`.

## Next Steps

- [Installation](/docs/installation) - Different ways to install Coda
- [Configuration](/docs/configuration) - Customize generation with `coda.config.mjs`
- [API Reference](/docs/api) - Complete CLI and programmatic API docs

## Example

Here's what a generated client looks like:

```typescript
import { createTransferInstruction } from "./generated/index.js";
import { createSolanaRpc } from "@solana/web3.js";

const rpc = createSolanaRpc("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");

const instruction = createTransferInstruction({
  source: sourceAddress,
  destination: destAddress,
  authority: authorityAddress,
  amount: 1000n
});
```
